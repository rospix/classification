# Rospix Classification

A ROS node for basic morphologic track classification.

![rospix](misc/rospix.png)

## Dependencies

To download the repository install **git** with **lfs*:
```bash
sudo apt install git git-lfs
```

To run the Python code, following python packages are required:
* **scikit-image** for image feature extraction
* **sklearn** 0.20.0 for machine learning and classification
```bash
sudo pip install scikit-image sklearn
```

## Real time classification

Coordinates of each cluster are relative to its top-left corner, the coordinates within the cluster are then relative to its position.

```bash
roslaunch rospix_classification real_time.launch
```
### Subscribed topics

The rospix output:
```
/track_classifier/image_in
```

### Published topics

The ROS image (possible to view using, e.g., rqt_image_view) showing labeled clusters:
```
/track_classifier/labeled_image
```

The classified data per each image:
```
/track_classifier/data
```

## Batch mode

In the batch mode, the ROS node takes CSV files in a given folder and processed them sequentially.
The node expects 1 image per input file, and the filenames in format ``filenamename.extension``.
As a results, it outputs two files per image, the 1st one containing overall image statistics, the 2nd one containing a cluster list.
Coordinates of each cluster are relative to its top-left corner, the coordinates within the cluster are then relative to its position.
The results, containing the statistics for each image and a list of clusters, are saved in JSON format.

The **input** and the **output** folders are set in the config file ```config/batch_processing.yaml```.

```yaml
# path will be relative to this package root folder
path_relative: True # use False if you plan on providing absolute filepaths
source_path: "datasets/set01in"
result_path: "datasets/set01out"
classifier_pipeline_path: "pipelines/vzlusat-1.joblib"

# delimiter for data on the input
input_delimiter: ','
```

To run the batch processing, issue the command:
```bash
roslaunch rospix_classification batch.launch
```
